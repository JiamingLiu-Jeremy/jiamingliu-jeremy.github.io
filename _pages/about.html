I am Jiaming Liu, a researcher working on computational imaging and generative AI, with a particular emphasis on medical imaging applications. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine &amp; Imaging (AIMI) at
<a href="https://aimi.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) in the Department of Electrical &amp; Systems Engineering (ESE) at Washington University in St. Louis (WashU), where I was advised by
<a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Professor Ulugbek S. Kamilov</a>.
Prior to WashU, I received my bachelor’s degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).
I have also spent time at research labs at
<a href="https://www.merl.com/">Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)</a>
and
<a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)</a>.
