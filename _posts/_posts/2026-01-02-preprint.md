&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **New Preprint:** "[Unified Semantic Bridge Model for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation]()" We propose the Unified Semantic Bridge Model (USBM), a fully self-supervised framework that learns diffusion bridges from a shared semantic latent space to each domain, enabling geometry-aware translation without cross-domain supervision.
