&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **In Press:** Our paper "[CoIL: Coordinate-based Internal Learning for Imaging Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05181)" has been on the IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging (TCI)!! It extends coordinate-based representation to computational imaging.  Here is a short video [summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LXagKec31U&feature=youtu.be).
