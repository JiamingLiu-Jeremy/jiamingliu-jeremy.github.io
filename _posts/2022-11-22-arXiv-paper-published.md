&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **New Preprint:** Our paper "[DOLCE: A Model-Based Probabilistic Diffusion Framework
for Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12340.pdf)" has been accepted at NeurIPS 2022! We present DOLCE, a new deep modelbased framework for LACT that uses a conditional diffusion model as an image prior.
