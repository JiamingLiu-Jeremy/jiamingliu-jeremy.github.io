Hi there! I am a final year Ph.D student in the [Computational Imaging Group (CIG)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/) advised by Professor [Ulugbek Kamilov](https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Ulugbek-Kamilov.html) at ESE Department, Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). Before starting the Ph.D, I received the B.Sc. degree in electronic and information engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2017, and the M.S. degree in electrical and engineering, in 2018, from Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. My research interests include optimization theory, computer vision, and inverse problem. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in our research!
