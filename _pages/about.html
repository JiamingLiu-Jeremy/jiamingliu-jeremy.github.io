I am Jiaming Liu, a researcher working on computational imaging and generative AI, with a particular emphasis on medical imaging applications. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine &amp; Imaging (AIMI) at
<a href="https://aimi.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) in the Department of ESE at WashU, where I was advised by
<a href="https://cigroup.wustl.edu/">Professor Ulugbek S. Kamilov</a>.
Prior to WashU, I received my bachelor’s degree from UESTC.
I have also spent time at research labs at
<a href="https://www.merl.com/">MERL</a>
and
<a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">LLNL</a>.
